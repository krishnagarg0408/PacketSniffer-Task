# Task-05: Python Packet Sniffer 🕵️‍♂️📡

This project is part of my Cybersecurity Internship at **Prodigy Infotech**.

It is a **Python-based Packet Sniffer** that captures and analyzes network packets for educational and ethical purposes.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Capture real-time network packets
- Extract important details like:
  - Source IP
  - Destination IP
  - Protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.)
  - Payload (if any)

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Uses the built-in `socket` module in Python to open raw sockets
- Listens for packets on the network interface
- Extracts headers and payload information
- Displays the packet data in a readable format

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Socket Programming**
- Optional: `scapy` or `struct` for decoding packet structures

---

## 💻 Files Included

- `packet_sniffer.py` – Main Python file to run the packet sniffer
- `output_sample.txt` – (Optional) A file containing sample packet logs
- Screenshots of code and output (if uploaded)
